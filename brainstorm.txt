-look at cuckoo sandbox and how we might integrate with the bro tool to identify compiled binaries
-basically make an open-source version of a Fireye box

-Hash the extracted file, determine if benign (do nothing) or malicious (block).
-Send directory to spin up cuckoo instance, detonate file and interrogate network traffic
-File executation behavious


##TODO##
-Figure out what we're going to visualize (malicious files, benign, etc.)
-How we're going to program this (python back-end?)
-We should probably sit down at some point and get all of this done
